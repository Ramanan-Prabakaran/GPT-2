# GPT-2 GPT-2 Transformer Implementation in TensorFlow
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes key components like multi-head self-attention, feed-forward networks, and positional embeddings, mimicking the architecture of OpenAI's GPT-2.

Features
✅ Implements Multi-Head Self-Attention for contextual learning
✅ Uses Layer Normalization and Dropout for training stability
✅ Includes Feed-Forward Network for feature transformation
✅ Supports causal masking to enforce autoregressive behavior
✅ Scalable with multiple Transformer blocks

Code Breakdown
MultiHeadSelfAttention: Implements the attention mechanism for capturing dependencies between words.

FeedForwardNetwork: Processes attention outputs for deeper feature extraction.

TransformerBlock: Combines attention and feed-forward layers to form a Transformer block.

GPT2 Model: Stacks multiple Transformer blocks to build the final GPT-2 model.
